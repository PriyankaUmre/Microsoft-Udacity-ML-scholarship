## Learning Path
1. Getting familiar with basic NLP concepts like <b>Bag of word model, n-gram, Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF</b>.
2. <b>Applying these concepts</b> to understand small corpus of text, possibly 10 sentences. Practising them on small corpus will help you completely understand what in happening and also take full control by modifying the data.
3. Try building various applications of NLP like
    1. Sentiment Analysis
    2. Sentences similarity
    3. Predicting next word in a sentence
